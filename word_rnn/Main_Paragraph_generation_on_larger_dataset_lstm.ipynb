              " '“sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. it was a few seconds before mr. dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. he didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. on the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! rejoice, for you- know-who has gone at last! even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”',\n",
